example config:
{
    package: .switches.433mhz
    component: Switch433Mhz
    constructor_args: {
        pin: 21                 # pin number or object
        file: "filename"        # filename where the captured sequences are stored. Has to be uploaded manually!
        name_on: "on_a"         # name of the sequence for turning the device on
        name_off: "off_a"      # name of the sequence for turning the device off
        # reps: 5               # optional, amount of times a frame is being sent
    }
}
Control 433Mhz devices (e.g. power sockets) with a cheap 433Mhz transmitter.
Uses the excellent library from Peter Hinch: https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython_remote
For this to work you need to have sequences captured and stores on the device.
How to do that is described in his repository.
Note: This component only works on the devices supported by Peter Hinch's library!
(esp32, pyboards but not esp8266).
Be careful with "reps", the amount of repitions as this currently uses a lot of RAM.

NOTE: additional constructor arguments are available from base classes, check COMPONENTS.md!
